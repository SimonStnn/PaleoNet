# Controls whether uncaught app exceptions and deprecation warnings
# are displayed in the browser. This can be one of the following:
# - "full"       : In the browser, Streamlit displays app deprecation
#                  warnings and exceptions, including exception types,
#                  exception messages, and associated tracebacks.
# - "stacktrace" : In the browser, Streamlit displays exceptions,
#                  including exception types, generic exception messages,
#                  and associated tracebacks. Deprecation warnings and
#                  full exception messages will only print to the
#                  console.
# - "type"       : In the browser, Streamlit displays exception types and
#                  generic exception messages. Deprecation warnings, full
#                  exception messages, and associated tracebacks only
#                  print to the console.
# - "none"       : In the browser, Streamlit displays generic exception
#                  messages. Deprecation warnings, full exception
#                  messages, associated tracebacks, and exception types
#                  will only print to the console.
# - True         : This is deprecated. Streamlit displays "full"
#                  error details.
# - False        : This is deprecated. Streamlit displays "stacktrace"
#                  error details.
# Default: "full"

# Change the visibility of items in the toolbar, options menu,
# and settings dialog (top right of the app).
# Allowed values:
# - "auto"      : Show the developer options if the app is accessed through
#                 localhost or through Streamlit Community Cloud as a developer.
#                 Hide them otherwise.
# - "developer" : Show the developer options.
# - "viewer"    : Hide the developer options.
# - "minimal"   : Show only options set externally (e.g. through
#                 Streamlit Community Cloud) or through st.set_page_config.
