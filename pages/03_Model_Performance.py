        ### About the Model
        
        Our model is built using transfer learning with EfficientNetB0 as the base model, which was pre-trained on ImageNet. 
        We fine-tuned the model on our dinosaur dataset with the following steps:
        
        1. Split the dataset into train (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets
        2. Used data augmentation for the training set
        3. First trained only the top layers while keeping the base model frozen
        4. Then fine-tuned the model by unfreezing the last 10% of the base model layers
        5. Used class weights to handle class imbalance
        
        ### Performance Analysis
        
        The model performs well on most species, achieving an overall accuracy of over 80%. 
        Some species are easier to classify than others due to distinctive features.
        
        Common misclassifications occur between:
        
        - Similar body types (e.g., bipedal carnivores)
        - Species with similar head crests or frills
        - Species commonly depicted in similar environments

    ### Class Balance Analysis
    
    The chart above shows the distribution of test images across different dinosaur species.
    A balanced dataset helps ensure that the model performs well across all classes and doesn't
    develop bias toward over-represented classes.
    
    During training, class weights were applied to compensate for any imbalance in the dataset.

    cells represent misclassifications.
